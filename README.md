# Co-VidSpeak
Co-VidSpeak was created from discussions by Bill Binko and
Brian Whitmer. We realized during the Covid-19 pandemic that
people on a breathing tube in the ICU are being physically 
isolated from family, but that a video call wouldn't be enough
to help the communicate.

We have family members and friends
who have been intubated in intensive care situations, and
wanted to make sure anyone in a socially isolated situation
could still have access to and communication with the 
people who were important to them.

## More Details
Co-VidSpeak is an open source communication tool built on 
WebRTC targeted at individuals with complex communication
needs. Imagine if you can't speak (either suddenly or
otherwise), but you still want to be able to connect with
people in your life. If you are in a hospital, care facility, 
or for other reasons can't connect with people who can 
provide you emotional support or therapy, then in theory
you could connect via video chat.

But video chat on its own doesn't support non-verbal 
communication. Co-VidSpeak provides a grid of buttons
wrapped around the video feed to allow people to hit
the buttons themselves, or indicate them using their
eyes so the other party can notice where they are looking
and acknowledge the communication.

There are other features as well, but those are the basics.

## Getting Started

... Contributions welcome!

## HIPAA

As long as the application and its hosting services, etc. 
request no user information and store no user information 
(other than transiently) including IP address and URL-based 
identifiers, photos, etc.
then (in theory) it can leverage the 
<b>conduit exception rule</b>, and 
does not need to enter into a Business Asssociate 
Agreement with the health provider.
